# The Forgotten Giants
This app is centered around the The Forgotten Giants and will provide you with a map to find the giants and information about transport. If you are within a distance of 10 meters of the giant, a reward screen will be triggered. It is then possible to read about or listen to the giant. Moreover, you can keep track of all the rewards that you have once gathered.
