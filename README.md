# The Forgotten Giants
This app is centered around the The Forgotten Giants and will provide you with a map to find the giants and information about the giants.

# Installation
For our app we have used [Expo](https://expo.io/learn). To set up the expo environment and libraries that allows you to run the code on a simulator:

Download [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - the latest version

Expo
```bash
npm install expo-cli --global
```

Geolib
```bash
npm install geolib
```

Navigate to the folder in which the project is saved (change directory) and write: “npm start”. A new tap-window will automatically open in your browser in which you can run the simulators.

# Simulators

## iOS
If you want to run the code on iPhone simulator, we recommend that you install Xcode.

## Android
If you want to run the code on Android simulator, we recommend that you install Android Studio. When opening the program; click on “Configure”, “AVD Manager” and “Create Virtual Device”.

## Own mobile device
If you want to the code run on your own mobile device, go to app store and download “Expo-client”. Then open your camera and scan the QR code that is displayed at the tap-window in your browser.
