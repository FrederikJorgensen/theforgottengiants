## The Forgotten Giants

To set up the expo environment that allows you to run the code on a simulator:

- Go to https://expo.io/learn.
- Download NodeJS - the latest version.
- Then continue the following steps at https://expo.io/learn in your terminal. You might have to write sudo in front of the command if it doesn’t compile.
- Navigate to the folder in which the project is saved (change directory) and write: “npm start”. A new tap-window will automatically open in your browser in which you can run the simulators.
- If you want to run the code on Android simulator, we recommend that you install Android Studio. When opening the program; click on “Configure”, “AVD Manager” and “Create Virtual Device”
- If you want to the code run on your own mobile device, go to app store and download “Expo-client”. Then open your camera and scan the QR code that is displayed at the tap-window in your browser.
